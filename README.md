List of small projects in Rust, they include all exercises in the rust book, my (Ongoing) solutions to some problems from LeetCode (some solutions also include leetcode solutions to test against) and some small experiments to understand async and macros better.

Also link to a link to a document i wrote to explore the inner workings of substrate FRAME [https://docs.google.com/document/d/16CZXxGWjTQyCALbfJNbt6g1a6aokzciThNjPN-bcfZE/edit?usp=sharing](url)
