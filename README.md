# rustProjects
List of small projects in Rust, they include all exercises in the rust book, my (Ongoing) solutions to some problems from LeetCode (some solutions also include leetcode solutions to test against) and some small experiments to understand async and macros better.

Also an introduction to a series of articels that take a look into the inner workings of susbtrate and my current work for the interlay hackathon (AmsterDot event)
