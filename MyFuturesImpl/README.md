# MyFutures
Implementing simple futures, with some useful coments, to understand async better in rust, inspiration from [this mini book](https://cfsamson.github.io/books-futures-explained/).

## Todos
* Adding a spawn method for the executor; the current implementation is limited and works like synchronous code although the foundations for asnyc are laid out.
* Unique task id for each task.
* Add async-std to make the implementation do something useful.
